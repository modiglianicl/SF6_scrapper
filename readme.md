## You need to use your user data directory!!
What it means is that you need to be already logged in in your Chrome Browser \n
You need to put your Google Chrome's user directory  on the ".env.template" file make sure to remove the ".template"!! \n
and make sure to follow the example on it!

## CSV file
Once it starts it will create a csv file with all the data from all the pages detected (it will take up to hours to scrap ALL the data) \n
I added a CSV file so you can see how the data is stored

## Maintenance
I will make sure to keep it working, if it fails and you know what to do check the css classes on the page and put them on the sf6_scrapper if you know what you are doing, they change from time to time!

## Next Versions
