## You need to use your user data directory!!
What it means is that you need to be already logged in in your Chrome Browser <br />
You need to put your Google Chrome's user directory  on the ".env.template" file make sure to remove the ".template"!! <br />
and make sure to follow the example on it!

## CSV file
Once it starts it will create a csv file with all the data from all the pages detected (it will take up to hours to scrap ALL the data) <br />
I added a CSV file so you can see how the data is stored.

## Maintenance
I will make sure to keep it working, if it fails and you know what to do check the css classes on the page and put them on the sf6_scrapper if you know what you are doing, they change from time to time!

## Next Versions
Error handling, more filters (how many pages, which character,etc),class auto detecting, code commented in english, auto general analysis.
